# C-HIP8
A Chip-8 emulator (interpreter) made in C++ using SDL.

It is mostly complete, it still needs some polishing but I'll move on to another project for now.
The goal for me was to understand how an emulator works and to get my hands dirty on a small project before tackling bigger projects.

# Usage
```console
~ make
~ ./c_hip8 [rom file]
```
I included a basic rom file in the roms folder but you can find a a lot of them online, like there : https://johnearnest.github.io/chip8Archive/

# Ressources
My main source of documentation was this wonderful guide : https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/
Complete enough to make it easy to understand, abstract enough to leave the implementation open
I also looked at some repositories of existing projects
